# Unity Game Development with Hybrid Component-Based Architecture

## Overview

Welcome to the Unity Game Development project utilizing a hybrid component-based architecture. This project demonstrates a pragmatic approach that seamlessly merges Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with the efficiency and performance gains of data-oriented design.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture:** Strike a balance between the benefits of OOP and data-oriented principles for a flexible and efficient game development structure.
- **Component-Based Design:** Components represent modular behaviors within entities, allowing for a clear and extensible game architecture.
- **Entity Management:** Entities, simple collections of components with unique IDs, provide a streamlined approach to handle game entities.
- **World Management:** Efficiently manage entities, components, and their interactions within the game world.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AzumoHQ/unity-ecs-blogpost
   ```

2. **Open in Unity:**
   - Open Unity Hub.
   - Add the project folder using the "Add" button in the Unity Hub.
   - Select the project to open in Unity.

3. **Explore the Code:**
   - Dive into the source code to understand the hybrid architecture, components, entities, and world management system.
   - Check the comments and documentation for a detailed explanation of each part.

## Usage

- **Create Entities:** Utilize the `CreateEntity` method in the `EntityContainer` class to efficiently generate entities with diverse components.
- **Remove Entities:** Use the `RemoveEntity` method to dismantle entities, recycling their IDs for memory optimization.

Happy coding!
